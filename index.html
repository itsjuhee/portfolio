                            I've been wanting to create right on the screen. I am also <br>
                            very interested in learning more efficient coding methods <br>
                            to find solutions, fix errors or problems, and maintain them. <br>

                            As a front-end developer, I really liked the role of being able to serve <br>
                            as a link to not only design but also to implement a screen. It was also nice <br>
                            to be able to get through the coding process on my own. No matter how <br>
                            difficult and difficult it is, if I can continue to learn and solve, I will work <br>
                            tirelessly to achieve it with the hope that one day it will be helpful to someone.

                                Currently, I am a new developer who can immerse myself in the end <br> 
                                to solve small inconveniences and problems for users <br> 
                                rather than great performance. I am looking for a company that <br> 
                                can trust and lead my growth potential.

                                and easy to understand for maintenance.
