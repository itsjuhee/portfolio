                            Classically, the main area of design was only <br> 
                            architecture, which was understood as the major arts. <br> 
                            The design of clothing, furniture, and other common <br>

                            Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production <br> 
                            and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web <br> 
                            graphic design; user interface design authoring, including standardised code <br> 
                            and proprietary software experience design and search engine optimization. <br> 
                            Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the <br> 
                            design process, although some designers will cover them all.
